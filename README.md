## 📋 Project Overview

This technical journal documents my 7-week journey implementing, securing, and evaluating a Linux server operating system. Through hands-on configuration, security hardening, and performance analysis, I've developed practical competencies in Linux administration, remote system management, and infrastructure security aligned with industry-standard practices.

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this coursework, I will demonstrate:

✅ **LO3:** Assess security vulnerabilities and apply appropriate security mechanisms  
✅ **LO4:** Demonstrate proficiency with CLI tools for system administration  
✅ **LO5:** Critically evaluate operating system design trade-offs and constraints

### Professional Skills Developed

- Deploy and manage basic Linux server infrastructure
- Configure and harden remote systems using SSH
- Develop automation scripts for security and monitoring
- Analyze and document technical trade-offs with quantitative data
- Implement industry-standard security controls
- Create professional technical documentation with diagrams
